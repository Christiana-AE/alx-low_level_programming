/* Write a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.

Usage: ./change cents
where cents is the amount of cents you need to give back
if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
you should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program
If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line
You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent
